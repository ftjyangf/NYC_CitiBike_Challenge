1. Duration of trip: Users tend to use city bikes more than 5 hours instead of a short period of time. 
2. Dividing the Graph by gender, we can see male customers are the major factor of contributors to arch shape trip duration graph. Female users behave in the same manner but with much 'mild' shape, meaning their usage duration is averagely distributed in 24 hours. The 'Unknown' group is a flat graph.
3. By checking the number of bikes used in each hour of weekdays, we can see there are two peak hours in each business day in a week, the first peak begins at 6AM and end at 9AM,and the second peak begins at 4PM and ends at 8PM. the patten seems constant from Monday to Friday, except Wednesday and friday with a little adjustment, especially Wednesday night.For saturday and sunday, the usage is more evenly spread out, the usage is slowly peak up from 8AM,then comes back at around 8PM 
4. By dividing the number of bike use in each hour of weekdays into gender groups, the story of gender contribution continues, male usage is the major force contributing to the graph, female users behave the same way with less number. Unknown groups evenly distributed in each hour segment. 
5. The visualization of usertype tells us the subscribed or active users have stable demand to our service.this group of users, both Male and Female,behave the same pattern on weekdays. In this part of analysis,we noticed the customers who don't subscribe our service exhibit activities, especially for the group of 
customer who doesn't want to reveal their gender identity.
