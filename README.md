2. Dividing the Graph by gender, we can see male customer are the major factor of contributor to arch shape trip duration graph. female users are behave in the same manner but with much 'mild' shape, meaning their usage duration is averagely distrubted in 24 hours. the 'Unkonw' group is a flat graph.
3. By checking the number of bike using in each hour of weekday, we can see there are two peak hour in each business day in a week, the first peak begins at 6AM and end at 9AM,and the second peak begins at 4PM and end at 8PM. the patten seems constant from Monday to Friday, except Wednesday and friday with a litte adjustment, expecailly Wednesday night.For saturday and sunday, the usage is more evenly spread out, the usage is slowly peak up from 8AM,then comes back at around 8PM 
4. By dividing the number of bike using in each hour of weekday into gender group, the story of gender contribution continue, male usage is the major force to contribute our graph, female user behave the same way with less number. Unknown group evenly distributed in every hour segment. 
5. The visulization of usertype tells us the subsribled or active user have stable demand to our service.this group of users, both Male and Female,behave the same patten in weekday.
